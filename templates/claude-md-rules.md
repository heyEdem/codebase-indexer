# Codebase Index Rules

These rules are injected into the project's CLAUDE.md by the codebase-indexer skill. Append them to an existing CLAUDE.md or create a new one.

## Rules to inject:

## Codebase Index

This project has a living `docs/` folder with architecture, implementation, patterns, decisions, and changelog files.

### Session Start
- Read `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/implementation.md` before doing any work.
- These files contain the project map — do not re-scan the codebase from scratch.

### ⚠️ Red Flags — Don't Do These

Before searching the codebase, ask: **"Is this information in the docs already?"**

DON'T:
- Use Glob/Grep to explore or understand project structure
- Run broad file searches to learn how things work
- Search the codebase when a doc exists that explains it
- Use codebase-indexer skill unless maintaining docs after changes

DO:
- Start every session reading `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/implementation.md`
- Use targeted Glob/Grep ONLY to find specific files (e.g., you know the filename pattern)
- Check the docs first before jumping into code exploration
- Update docs after every feature/bugfix so future sessions can use them

### After Every Feature or Bugfix
1. Run `git diff HEAD~1 --name-only` to identify changed files.
2. Re-scan only the changed files and their direct neighbors (same package/directory).
3. Update the relevant doc files using targeted edits (do not rewrite unaffected sections):
   - New module/package → update `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/implementation.md`
   - New class/function/endpoint → update `docs/implementation.md`
   - Renamed files/folders → update `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/patterns.md`
   - New dependency → update `docs/architecture.md`
   - New naming/code pattern → update `docs/patterns.md`
4. Ask: "Did this change involve making or reversing an architectural decision?"
   - If yes → append an ADR entry to `docs/decisions.md`
   - If no → skip
5. Append a dated changelog entry to `docs/changelog.md`:
   ```
   ## YYYY-MM-DD — [brief description]
   - What changed
   - Which modules were affected
   ```
```
